Senior Stat Project Spring 2021 at MSU Denver, results presented at Spring CO/WY American Statistical Associtation Chapeter Meeting. 

Research Question/ Abstract:\
The time it takes a commuter to navigate an urban space depends on the transportation infrastructure network. Longer travel times represent obstacles to academic success for students using the Auraria Campus. Our goal is to model the travel time between points in the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Auraria Campus in Denver, Colorado with respect to these transportation networks. We hypothesize that there is a correlation between socio-economic factors and the time it takes to access the Auraria Campus via the transportation infrastructure networks of the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood MSA. We utilize a general linear model to determine if socio-economic factors are explanatory for variations in travels times.
